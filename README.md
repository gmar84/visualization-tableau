Question 1: Which Airports/Airlines have the most delays?
https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/greg.martin6911/viz/WGUDataVisualizationProject-Question1/Story1?publish=yes

Insight Gained: ORD, ATL, and DFW are the top 3 Airports with the most delays. WN, UA, and AA are the top 3 Airlines with the most delays.

Question 2: What causes delays?

Insight Gained: Departure delays accounted for the majority of the delays.

Question 3: As a frequent flier, which airlines spend more time in the air, and travel the furthest distance?

Insight Gained: Southwest Airlines has the most distance travelled, as well as the most air time.

Summary: The story is focused around airport delays, which airports have the most, what causes the delays, and as a bonus question, distance & air time by Airline.

Design: The tree maps in Question 1 were a good choice here because of the way it conveys the data. It uses different size blocks to quickly and easily show which Airports/Airlines have the most delays. Question 2 shows the delay reasons in a simple bar chart, so that the reader can easily see the top reasons, and then another that shows the delay reasons by Airline. I added filters for both charts so that the reader can focus on specific measures if desired.
Question 3 was not related to the other 2 â€“ it was something I thought might be a consideration for passengers wanting to maximize reward programs by choosing an airline with more distance/air time. I use side-by-side bar chart, since we are comparing 2 values (Distance and Air Time) by each Airline. I used these two values, just in case some airlines use distance travelled, and some use time spent in the air.
